      <p>
        Hi! I’m Chirag, and for the last 5+ years, I’ve dedicated my professional life to helping startups, agencies, and businesses launch amazing products—without code.
        My journey with <span class="font-semibold text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400">Bubble.io</span> began when I built and shipped an MVP in a single weekend, and since then, I’ve never looked back.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Bubble?</h3>
      <p>
        No-code has changed the game for software development. Bubble in particular has enabled entrepreneurs and teams to move from idea to launch in weeks—not months. From CRM tools and two-sided marketplaces to fully-featured SaaS platforms, I've built, scaled, and coached it all.
      </p>
      <h3>What I Bring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>End-to-end Bubble delivery:</b> MVPs, SaaS, marketplaces, internal tools</li>
        <li><b>Product/UX vision:</b> User-focused, modern design and flows</li>
        <li><b>API integrations:</b> Stripe, Zapier, external databases, and more</li>
        <li><b>Performance audits:</b> Fast, scalable, and future-proof apps</li>
        <li><b>Mentoring and workshops:</b> Helping teams master Bubble and no-code tools</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>My Approach</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a strong believer in lean, iterative launches: demo early, gather feedback, and adapt. My process combines creative problem solving with a relentless focus on your goals—and a truly collaborative, transparent workflow.
      </p>
      <h3>Let's Connect!</h3>
